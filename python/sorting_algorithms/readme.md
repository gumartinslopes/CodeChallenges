# Sorting Algorithms
## Bubble Sort O(n^2)
The simplest sorting algorithm. Its complexity is O(n^2) in all three cases as it will always go
through all n elements n times.
## Insertion Sort O(n) -> O(n^2)
A good sorting algorithm to use when your array is almost sorted. Its complexity is O(n) in the 
best case(sorted array) and O(n^2) in the worst case (array in the reverse order).
